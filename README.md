Cyberbullying Text Classification using NLP Techniques

Overview
This project aims to classify text data to detect cyberbullying using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The model is designed to identify harmful or abusive language in social media posts or messages to prevent and mitigate cyberbullying.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

## Techniques Used
The project utilizes the following NLP techniques and algorithms:
- Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and stop-word removal.
- Feature Extraction: TF-IDF, Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe).
- Algorithms: 
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Simple RNN
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix.

## Results
The LSTM model achieved the following results:
- Accuracy: 95%
- Precision: 95%
- Recall: 95%
- F1-Score: 95%

## Acknowledgments
- Libraries: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, NLTK
- Dataset: Acknowledgments to the dataset providers for cyberbullying text data.
